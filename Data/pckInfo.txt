#This code is going to remove the leading zero(s) if any.
match = re.match("/^([ABDGHJLMR])-?0{1,2}(\d{1,3})([A-Z]?)/", line.["item ID"])

#if it's an A series icon take away the "M" or "P" at the end.  
#For anything else: leave whatever letter comes after the numbers.  You have to write code to 
#add the size code and an "M" if it is any size other than 8 x 10
if match.group(0)[0] == “A”:
    sku = "A-" + match.group(2)
else:

Some of the prices are ambiguous - assume the verison of the icon which is more commono
